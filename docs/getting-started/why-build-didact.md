# Why Build Didact?

So why build Didact? Aren't there other solutions already in place?

## Jealous of Python

I have been jealous for years of the explosion of job orchestrators over in the Python world. It seems to have started with [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) being open sourced from AirBnB, but it's only taken off from there. Now you can find several different orchestration platforms in Python today, such as [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) and [Dagster](https://dagster.io/).

They are large, well-documented, and VC-funded, so naturally, as a solo dev/indie hacker, they caught my attention.

As someone whose career started in data analytics and data engineering before becoming engulfed with fullstack software development, I have a particular passion for managing background jobs, data pipelines, and workflows.
