# Uses Cases

Didact is ideal for several different use cases.

## Background Jobs

Asynchronous, parallelizable, reliable, and persistent background jobs are often a critical piece of production infrastructure for a business of any size, from the smallest to the largest operations.

Software designed to handle this job function (pun intended) needs to be highly performant, expose a high degree of observability into what's running, capture critical logging events, and be well-documented.

## Data Pipelines and ETL
