# Meet the Team

## My Story

Hi, I'm Daniel, the founder and maintainer of Didact. I'm a solo, bootstrapped, indie-hacking software developer and data engineer. After binge-watching an unhealthy amount of [MicroConf Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@MicroConf) and discovering the [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) community, I decided that I wanted to try and support myself from my own projects and apps.

### My Portfolio

Didact is project #2 in my portfolio, behind project #1 [Displagent](https://www.displagent.io), a micro SaaS app I designed for advanced slideshow mechanics and digital signage in Power BI.

As you can see, I have a natural gravitation towards solving problems in Microsoft ecosystems.

### Solo and Bootstrapped

As I said, I'm a solo, bootstrapped founder, meaning I have not taken **any** funding whatsoever, not from venture capitalists, not from angel investors, and not from anyone else. Didact is funded from my own pocket and from any monetization models that I can pull off for it on Didact's [Pricing](https://www.didact.dev/pricing) page.

I think this makes Didact, and by extension, myself, rather unique in the job orchestration community as whole, because if you look at any other platform similar to Didact, such as:

* Prefect
* Dagster
* Kestra
* Inngest

They all have two things in common:

1. They are venture-capital funded.
2. They have an entire team of fulltime engineers.

And then there's me and Didact. But I'm confident and positive about what the future holds. Indie hackers have a knack for pulling off what otherwise seems impossible, and with the open source community behind me, I'm confident that I can make Didact a fulltime gig for myself.

> Any support or pricing plans that you purchase go towards this project's sustainability and help me pay my bills, and I cannot thank you enough.
