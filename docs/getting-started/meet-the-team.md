# Meet the Team

## My Story

Hi, I'm Daniel, the founder and maintainer of Didact. I'm a solopreneur/bootstrapper/indie hacker with a great passion for software development and data engineering. After binge-watching an unhealthy amount of [MicroConf Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@MicroConf) and discovering the [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) community, I decided that I wanted to build, sell, and share my own side projects.

### My Portfolio

Didact is actually project #2 in my portfolio. My first project is a micro SaaS Electron app for Power BI digital signage, called [Displagent](https://www.displagent.io).

As you can see, I have a natural gravitation towards solving problems in Microsoft ecosystems and focusing on data-centric software.

### Solo and Bootstrapped

As I said, I'm a solo, bootstrapped founder, meaning I have not taken any funding whatsoever, not from venture capitalists, not from angel investors, not from anyone. Didact is funded from my own pocket and from any successful monetization of the project (shameless plugin to the [Pricing](https://www.didact.dev/pricing) page).

I think this makes Didact, and by extension, myself, rather unique in the job orchestration community because if you look at any other platform similar to Didact, such as:

* Prefect
* Dagster
* Kestra
* Inngest
* And more

They all have two things in common:

1. They are venture-capital funded.
2. They have an entire team of fulltime engineers.

But if there's one thing I like, it's a challenge. And as a bootstrapper, I am forced to run lean, think critically, and make the most of my precious time. And since I'm solo, I'm small, fast, and love high-velocity micro-improvements.
