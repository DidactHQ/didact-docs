# Open Source Contributing

Since Didact is currently taking the polyrepo approach to code organization, it will make everyone's lives much easier if issues are opened *with respect to what repository they belong with*.

In other words:

- For issues with the REST API and execution engine, please open up issues in the [didact-engine](https://github.com/DidactHQ/didact-engine) repo.
- For issues with the VueJS web dashboard, please open up issues in the [didact-ui](https://github.com/DidactHQ/didact-ui) repo.
- For issues with the console application, please open up issues in the [didact-sentinel](https://github.com/DidactHQ/didact-sentinel).
- For issues with core nuget package, please open up issues in the [didact-core](https://github.com/DidactHQ/didact-core) repo.

It's not the end of the world by any means if you don't follow this guideline, but it will save me work and issue duplication if this general guide is followed.

::: info No need to die on that hill
Again, I want to emphasize that I am **not** anti-monorepo: if the issue tracking becomes unmaintainable, I'm happy to consider an alternative approach to code organization.
