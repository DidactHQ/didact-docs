# Installation

Unlike other projects, Didact provides you with prebuilt binaries/executables and prebuilt Docker images that are ready for download and immediate execution. This prevents you from having to go through cumbersome steps of cloning git repos, producing build files, enforcing version matching, building Docker images, and so on.

Even better, Didact provides a dedicated CLI tool for your convenience to easily utilize the platform in its entirety. The CLI is excellent for both local development as well as production deployments and can be conveniently utilized later on in CI/CD scripts.
