# Utilities and Help

There are some utilities and help links included in Displagent for housekeeping and troubleshooting.

## Help Menu

There is a help menu on the titlebar of the app. Below are its links and their usages:

* `About`: opens a dialog box with metadata about the app (e.g. version).
* `Open Logs`: automatically opens the file explorer on your system to the logs folder.
* `Open Documentation`: automatically opens the Displagent docsite in your default browser.
* `Reset Power BI Credentials`: deletes the local `powerbiconnectionsettings.json` file.

::: warning
Deleting the `powerbiconnectionsettings.json` file *will* break the app. You will need to enter new credentials afterwards in order for the app to work again.
