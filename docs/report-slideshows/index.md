# Report Slideshows

This section introduces you to Report Slideshows and how to build them.

## What is a Report Slideshow?

A Report Slideshow is a Displagent slideshow type that is built from a specific Power BI *report*.

::: warning
Don't forget the differences between a Power BI *report* and a Power BI *dashboard*. Recall that a Power BI *dashboard* is a set of pinned visuals or visual pages from one or more Power BI reports. However, what you create in the Power BI Desktop program are Power BI *reports*.
:::

A Report Slideshow is limited to **one, specific Power BI report** from a given Power BI workspace. The report can be from any workspace, so long as your service account that you used during setup has access to the workspace.

::: tip
Many Early Adopters have asked if Report Slideshows can support **more than one Power BI report at a time**. Per their design, they cannot.

*However*, I am currently in the process of building Compound Slideshows, and inside a Compound Slideshow, you will be able to combine multiple, individual Power BI Report Slideshows as well as Dashboard Slideshows into large, master slideshows.

Compound Slideshows are currently **under development**, so please signup and lookout for a feature update email in the near future!

## Highly Customizable

Power BI reports are highly customizable artifacts in Power BI, so I wanted you to be able to build highly-customizable slideshows to accompany them. As you will see in the following pages, you can quite literally build your Report Slideshow one piece at a time and use a variety of features available to you for advnaced configurations, such as using using bookmarks, setting a slideshow item ordering for each slideshow item, and setting a refresh interval on the slideshow itself.
