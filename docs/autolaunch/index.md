# Autolaunch

Autolaunch is a feature which allows Displagent to automatically start a Slideshow and Slideshow Type of your choosing upon machine startup. This is an essential and highly-requested feature to give your display a true unattended, kiosk-like experience.

When you choose the autolaunch settings (as discussed on the following page), Displagent will create an `autolaunchsettings.json` file on your machine to easily execute autolaunch anytime the app starts.

::: warning Important
Each autolaunch is isolated to the machine that Displagent is installed on. Consequently, you will need to setup autolaunch on each machine that you install Displagent on.
